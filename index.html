        <h2>Chapter 1: Have They Taught You to Strive While Others Are Suffering?</h2>
        <div class="question-block">
          <p>Have they taught you<br>
          to forget everyone and everything in the world—<br>
          to focus only on striving,<br>
          on making profit,<br>
          on gaining status,<br>
          on building your own story of life and pleasures,<br>
          on taking what you can from this world to uplift yourself—</p>
          <p>and that you shouldn’t worry about others’ fortunes,<br>
          even if they are dying, suffering, starving, or in danger?</p>
          <p><strong>They taught me.</strong><br>
          They taught me<br>
          to strive<br>
          while the world is burning.</p>
          <p><strong>They taught me.</strong><br>
          They taught me<br>
          to care less,<br>
          to be cold,<br>
          to show no feelings,<br>
          and to strive for greatness.</p>
          <p>They even taught me<br>
          to be better than everyone else—<br>
          because a parent wishes their child<br>
          to be better than everyone else.</p>
          <p>Do you know<br>
          that I never believed I was better than anyone else?</p>
          <p>Do you know<br>
          that I see myself in everyone and everything in this world?</p>
          <p>That I value the trees,<br>
          the ground,<br>
          the animals,<br>
          the bugs,<br>
          the humans,<br>
          the cosmos,<br>
          the universe,<br>
          the black holes,<br>
          and everything that exists?</p>
          <p>That I even question<br>
          whether non-existence also exists?</p>
          <p>I see it<br>
          in my mind<br>
          when I think about nothingness—<br>
          trying to make sense of it.</p>
          <p>It becomes<br>
          nothing but an imagined idea in my head,<br>
          as if it’s part of a puzzle<br>
          I’ll never finish.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Have They Taught You That Helping Others Is a Weakness?</h2>
        <div class="question-block">
          <p>Have they taught you<br>
          that helping people in need is wrong,<br>
          because it might affect your image,<br>
          your time,<br>
          your health,<br>
          your emotions,<br>
          or your future?</p>
          <p>Have they taught you<br>
          that those who struggle are beneath you?<br>
          That their lives are just a sad footnote?<br>
          That death will eventually take them anyway?</p>
          <p>Then what makes you so different?</p>
          <p>You’re not stronger than death.<br>
          And surviving a little longer doesn’t mean you’ve escaped anything.</p>
          <p>So why hoard the world’s pleasures<br>
          when you could help someone survive a little longer—<br>
          not just with food or money,<br>
          but with dignity?</p>
          <p>What does your time mean,<br>
          if time itself is running out for everyone?</p>

        <div class="question-block">
          <p>Have they taught you<br>
          to become so cold-hearted<br>
          that you can’t even see those crying for help?</p>
          <p>People pray for your kindness.<br>
          They hope you'll see them.</p>
          <p>But you laugh<br>
          on rooftops,<br>
          on boats,<br>
          on balconies—<br>
          high above the world.</p>
          <p>You talk about the poor,<br>
          while drinking,<br>
          while smoking,<br>
          as if they are distant stories.</p>
          <p>Have you read any of the sacred books?<br>
          The Qur’an.<br>
          The Bible.<br>
          The Torah.<br>
          Or any spiritual text<br>
          that warns against this illusion?</p>
          <p>Have they not reminded you<br>
          that this world isn’t all there is?</p>
          <p>So what are you fighting for?<br>
          Are you only trying to survive a little longer?</p>
          <p>If you believe in nothing—<br>
          how do you explain your own life?</p>
          <p>Who came first: you, or existence?</p>
          <p>You didn’t choose to be born.<br>
          You didn’t design your breath,<br>
          your bones,<br>
          or your body.</p>
          <p>You’re part of something bigger.<br>
          You didn’t build yourself alone.</p>
          <p>So why pretend otherwise?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4: Have They Taught You That Success Belongs to You Alone?</h2>
        <div class="question-block">
          <p>Why is your fortune more important than someone else's?</p>
          <p>Did you succeed without food?<br>
          Without oxygen?<br>
          Without shelter?<br>
          Without people working to plant, harvest, and deliver your meals?</p>
          <p>Didn’t someone work<br>
          so you could survive long enough<br>
          to study,<br>
          graduate,<br>
          and "succeed"?</p>
          <p>You didn’t become successful on your own—<br>
          because no one does.<br>
          Only nature is self-sustaining.<br>
          Only existence supports itself.</p>
          <p>Didn’t your cells, your bacteria, your DNA hold you together?<br>
          Didn’t Earth give you a body to live in?</p>
          <p>You share this world with those who have less.<br>
          With those who struggle.<br>
          With those who didn’t get your chances.</p>
          <p>And still—this world teaches you<br>
          to believe you earned everything<br>
          by yourself.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5: Have They Taught You That This Is Just the Way It Is?</h2>
        <div class="question-block">
          <p>My friend, the world is crying.<br>
          And you hear it.</p>
          <p>You see protests.<br>
          You see people begging for change.<br>
          You’ve heard about Africa.<br>
          The Middle East.<br>
          Palestine.<br>
          Sudan.<br>
          Yemen.<br>
          Ukraine.<br>
          The United States.<br>
          And everywhere in between.</p>
          <p>You’ve heard that an ambulance ride costs money.<br>
          That people go bankrupt trying to stay alive.</p>
          <p>What happened to universal care?<br>
          To free healing?<br>
          To food as a right, not a privilege?</p>
          <p>Why do we live in a world where money defines your value—<br>
          instead of your work?</p>
          <p>Why can’t people do what they love—<br>
          and be supported for it?</p>
          <p>What if you were a farmer,<br>
          and your food was shared freely?</p>
          <p>What if a chemist made sure it was safe?<br>
          A biologist ensured your health?<br>
          A teacher helped you understand the world?<br>
          A builder gave you shelter?</p>
          <p>Imagine a world where money didn’t dominate—<br>
          but effort, care, and contribution did.</p>
          <p>Or maybe this dream of mine is naïve.</p>
          <p>Maybe this is just another system.<br>
          Maybe it’s another illusion.</p>
          <p>Sometimes I wonder…<br>
          am I thinking like someone trying to play God?<br>
          Trying to fix the world through words?</p>
          <p>That’s not what I want.</p>
          <p>Please don’t worship these words.<br>
          Don’t follow me.<br>
          Return to your books.<br>
          To your conscience.<br>
          To your God.</p>
          <p>Ask for what’s right.<br>
          Ask how to live.</p>
          <p>Forgive me if I sound lost.<br>
          This is just how I feel<br>
          after watching so much suffering.<br>
          After hearing the same cries<br>
          and seeing no end to them.</p>
          <p>It’s wearing me down.</p>
          <p>I don’t always trust that change will come.<br>
          Sometimes I just can’t hold the weight anymore.</p>
          <p>I don’t feel joy<br>
          when I know people are suffering.<br>
          It echoes inside me.</p>
          <p>Every day.</p>

        <h1>Have You Forgotten?</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <div class="question-block">
          <p>Have you forgotten the body you were given, and the forces that sustain it?</p>
          <p>Didn’t your DNA, bacteria, and cells work hard just to keep you alive?</p>
          <p>Didn’t the cosmos move in such precision for you to have this moment, this breath?</p>
          <p>Do you exist apart from existence itself?</p>
          <p>Or are you sharing the same existential domain as every other person—rich or poor, healthy or sick, powerful or weak?</p>
          <p>Have you forgotten the Earth is bigger than you?</p>
          <p>And yet you act as if you are above it—indulging in luxuries, thinking they are yours to own.</p>
          <p>You forget that success is not yours to hoard. It is a responsibility gifted by something greater.</p>
          <p>The Earth gives you breath, food, water, sleep, shelter, company, even your ego.<br>
          And all of it can be taken away.</p>
