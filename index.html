      <h1>Have They Taught Wrong?</h1>

      <section class="question">
        <p><strong>1)</strong> Have they taught you to forget everyone and everything in the world and focus only on striving, making profit, gaining status, creating your own story of life and pleasures, taking what you can from this world to uplift yourself, and that you should not worry about others’ fortunes whether they are dying, suffering, starving, or in danger?</p>
        
        <p><em>They taught me.</em></p>

        <p>They taught me to strive while the world is burning.</p>

        <p><em>They taught me.</em></p>

        <p>They taught me to care less, to be cold, to show no feelings, and to strive for greatness. They even taught me to be better than everyone else, because a parent wishes their son and daughter to be better than everyone else.</p>

        <p><em>They taught me.</em></p>

        <p>Do you know</p>

        <p>that I never believed I was better than anyone else?</p>

        <p>Do you know</p>

        <p>that I see myself in everyone and everything in this world?</p>

        <p>Do you know that I value the trees, ground, animals, bugs, humans, cosmos, universe, black holes, and everything that exists?</p>

        <p>Do you know that I even question whether non-existence also exists?</p>

        <p>I see it</p>

        <p>in my mind whenever I think about nothingness, trying to make sense of its existence. It becomes nothing but an imagined idea in my head, as if it is part of a puzzle in my mind.</p>
